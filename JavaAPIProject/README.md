# Jlox Code Editor
This project loads and saves text files and can call the ChatGPT API for debugging code. It also has other functionality like finding keywords, automatic code folding, code highlighting and running the code.

If you want to see all my commits, I did it on my main account but I just copied the files here for the assignment: https://github.com/ZarmDev/Jlox-Editor
